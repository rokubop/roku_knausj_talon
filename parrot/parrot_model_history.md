# model-o:
start: 2023-8-22
end: 2023-9-2
- Consistent model
- ss and sh are inconsistent on my shockz, and mod mic
- cluck keeps waking up when I don't want it to

# 2023-9-2 model-p: CURRENT
start: 2023-9-22
end: present
- ac was on a lot of the time but I don't think it mattered
- Recorded with blue yeti, mod mic, and shockz 2
- Recorded new sounds: ay, cough, oo, t
- Rerecorded as the same: palette, sh, ss, yi, eh
- Rerecorded as flat tone: ah and oh
## VERDICT
good consistency 14 unique sounds.
have to combine ay with eh though. and oh with oo.

- record 3 mics
- previous model had conflicts with ay/ee/eh, and sometimes oo/oh
- love t sound from previous model. works really well.
- omit ay
- record ah, alveolar click, eh, er, guh, k, nn, oh, oo, Palate, pop, sh, ss, t, tut, yi
- new sound k
VERDICT: recording k conflicts with guh too much, so revert
